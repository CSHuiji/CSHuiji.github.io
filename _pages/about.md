I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Information Science Department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/). I am fourtunate to have Prof. [Pengfei Zhou](https://zhoupf.github.io/) to be my academia advisor. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research focuses on AI/ML in healthcare. My overarching research goal is to develop generalizable machine learning methodologies that bolster the trustworthiness and equity of AI/ML implementations in the real world. Current research areas include **AI Healthcare**, **Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)** and **Large Language Model Deploy**.
